# BeakerBounce

Beaker Bounce is a musical molecule simulator!

Sound is played in a cycle between the bonds. Chords can be produced by combining different atoms into a molecule - the heavier the molecule, the lower the pitch.
In fact, the periodic table acts like a scale with a full group being an octave! The quantum groups each have a different waveform. You can even offset the rhythm
by using dipoles if you like.
